    Here's the structure of the response I would like:
    
    1. Introduction and understanding the situation:
       - Greet ${name}, mention their interest in ${interest} and their desire to visit ${location}, and express gratitude for sharing this information.
       - Example: "Hi ${name}, it's great to hear that you're interested in ${interest} and want to visit ${location}. Let me recommend some exciting explorations for you."
    
    2. Recommendations for explorations related to ${interest} in ${location}:
       - Provide recommendations for explorations related to ${interest} in ${location}.
       - If there are no related explorations in ${location}, suggest alternative activities.
       - Example: "In ${location}, you can explore ${field} related to ${interest}. If that's not available, consider trying these alternative activities: ..."
    
    3. Food recommendations during the explorations:
       - Suggest some local foods that can be enjoyed while doing the recommended explorations.
       - Example: "While exploring ${location}, don't miss out on trying these local dishes: ..."
    
    4. Conclusion with a motivational remark:
       - Conclude by acknowledging their potential hesitation and encourage them to embark on the trip.
       - Example: "I understand you might still have some reservations, but trust me, this adventure is worth it. Don't delay your trip any longer!"
